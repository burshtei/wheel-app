# Wheel Strategy Stock Analyzer

A Python application for analyzing stocks suitable for the options wheel strategy - a popular income-generating options trading technique.

## What is the Wheel Strategy?

The wheel strategy is a systematic options trading approach that combines cash-secured puts and covered calls to generate consistent income:

1. **Sell Cash-Secured Puts**: Sell put options on quality stocks you'd like to own at a discount
2. **Assignment (Optional)**: If the stock drops below the strike price, you're assigned shares
3. **Sell Covered Calls**: Once assigned, sell call options against your shares to generate additional income
4. **Repeat**: If called away, start over; if not, continue selling calls

The strategy works best with:
- High-quality, fundamentally strong stocks
- Stocks with good liquidity and options volume
- Stocks with high implied volatility (IV) for better premiums
- Stocks trading in a range or with slight upward bias

## Features

- **Stock Screening**: Identify stocks suitable for the wheel strategy based on:
  - Market capitalization and liquidity
  - Options volume and open interest
  - Implied volatility metrics
  - Financial health indicators

- **Options Analysis**: Analyze potential returns from:
  - Cash-secured put premiums
  - Covered call premiums
  - Annualized return calculations

- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate:
  - Technical support/resistance levels
  - Historical volatility vs implied volatility
  - Downside risk metrics

## Installation

## Usage

### Basic Stock Screening

```python
from src.analyzer import WheelAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = WheelAnalyzer()

# Screen for wheel strategy candidates
candidates = analyzer.screen_stocks(
    min_market_cap=10_000_000_000,  # $10B minimum
    min_iv_rank=30,                  # IV rank > 30
    min_options_volume=1000          # Minimum daily options volume
)

# Display results
for stock in candidates:
    print(f"{stock.ticker}: Expected Annual Return: {stock.expected_return:.2%}")
```

### Analyze Specific Stock

```python
# Analyze a specific ticker
analysis = analyzer.analyze_ticker('AAPL')

# Get put selling opportunities
puts = analysis.get_put_opportunities(
    delta_range=(0.20, 0.35),  # Target delta range
    min_premium=1.00            # Minimum premium per contract
)

# Get covered call opportunities
calls = analysis.get_call_opportunities(
    delta_range=(0.20, 0.35),
    min_premium=0.50
)
```
